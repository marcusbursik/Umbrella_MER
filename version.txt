Version 0.5:

Changed so that rhobar, rhogas and N now calculated from brightness temperatures and 
sounding available to forecaster.  These are different therefore than in Pouget et
al (2013).  No longer therefore uses virtual potential temperature, but need to get
pressure at NBL, P0.  

Version 0.4:

Mostly added functionality to estimate a non-varying mass flux value, check better for 
cloud behavior, estimate eruption duration, and estimate uncertainty.

Version 0.3:

Fixed some bugs so that makes transition from umbrella to downwind plume correctly, getting
path correctly, and in computing power-law exponents for area rather than radius in
curve fits.

Version 0.1, 0.2:

At present, there are two main functionalities contained within the modules / programs. 
The first is concerned with estimation of the mass eruption rate (MER) from satellite-based, 
plume growth data. The second is concerned with a calculation of the shape of the plume.  This
algorithm allows for the generation of the measurements of minimum and maximum axes of a
plume to determine its degree of elongation, hence whether it is acting as an umbrella cloud 
or a downwind plume.
